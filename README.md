### Hi there,

I'm working on expanding my skills with Python, building projects and exploring the packages available.
My goal is to become confident with using **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **Django**,  **Bootstrap** and **SQL**, then expand into other technologies as the need arises.

You can find me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauracallaghan/
